# Comparative-Analysis-of-Deep-Learning-Frameworks-for-AI-generated-Fake-Text-Detection

This project was created to compare various deep learning frameworks in identifying fake text from real text.
The main focus is to compare the functionalities provided by these frameworks while keep everything else constant.
The PyTorch, Keras and JAX frameworks were compared in this project. Files for each implementation are uploaded.
In addition to that, the final report inclding the findings is also uploaded.
